I present you the data injection (DI) attack, denial-of-
service (DoS) attack, network error (NE), and replay (RE)
attack for GOOSE communications. 

These attacks can be described as follows. A failure to satisfy at least one
recommendation leads to the relevant attack.

Attacks/errors on GOOSE datasets:
- DI: If data has the same “DM” and “SM,” “sqNum”
should be increased every time.
- DI: If there is any change in “data1” or “data2,”
“stNum” should be increased by 1 and “sqNum” should
be reset to 0.
- DI: If the data has the same “DM” and “SM,” once
“stNum” is increased, it cannot go back to a smaller
number.
- DoS: There are up to 10 packets (rows) within 10
microseconds.
- NE: There should be a packet (dataset) within 10 s.
- RE: If there is any change in “data1” or “data2,”
“stNum” should be increased 1 and “sqNum” should be
reset to 0.
