# AMS 559 Smart Energy

The security of digital substations is pivotal in the operations of smart grid. These substations rely on intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) for real-time data exchange and control defined by the IEC 61850 standard of the Generic Object-Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) protocol. Presently, the predominant approach for anomaly detection in standardized GOOSE communications relies on Machine Learning (ML) techniques. While these methods demonstrate impressive accuracy, ML techniques face the challenge of needing retraining whenever new attack types arise. This retraining process involves gathering extensive datasets, leaving the system vulnerable in the interim. The proposed work aims to utilize the contextual understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT for anomaly detection in the GOOSE protocol. We achieved this by developing a method to feed ChatGPT full GOOSE network packet traces and provide suggestions on identifying attack types, thereby incorporating Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) training. We also aimed to explore the potential of LLMs to offer comprehensive insights and explanations, known as Natural Language Explanations, regarding potential attacks. Based on our experimental results, the potential of LLMs to enhance the security of digital substations, showcasing promising results with improved accuracy and explainability in detecting anomalies in GOOSE communications.
